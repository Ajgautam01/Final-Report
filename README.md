**# Week 1 Installation Ubuntu and Android Studio **

1.   **Download Ubuntu** You can download the latest version of the Ubuntu desktop iso image from the Ubuntu website.(https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
2.  **Create a bootable USB disk :** Use Universal USB Installer (BIOS compatible) or Rufus (UEFI compatible) to make a bootable USB disk
3.  **Boot from bootable USB :** Power on your system and press the ESC, F2, F10, F12, or DEL key to select the boot order.

Then, you need to select boot from USB or removable drive and to boot from USB.
4.**Preparing to Install Ubuntu :** Ubuntu image will begin to load. Do not interrupt the booting of the Ubuntu image.When the system is completely booted from Live USB, you will get the OS installer that looks like below.

To install Ubuntu, click on the Install Ubuntu button.
Choose your keyboard layout. In case, if you don't know about your keyboard layout, use the Detect Keyboard Layout option. 
5.  **Normal/Minimal Installation :** On this screen, you need to pick the applications for installation.

*Normal Installation -* You will get a graphical desktop with all standard software.

*Minimal Installation -* You will get a basic desktop with an internet browser and core system utilities.

You can either decide to install updates and other third-party software while installing Ubuntu or leave it (you can install them later if you need).

The updates and third-party software installation requires a functioning internet connection with your system. The installation may take somewhat additional time relies on the downloadable contents.

For this demo, I decided to do the Ubuntu Normal installation.
